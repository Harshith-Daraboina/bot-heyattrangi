--------------------------------------------------
ATTENTION-DEFICIT / HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD)
--------------------------------------------------

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or

DSM-5-TR CRITERIA SUMMARY:
- Several symptoms must be present before age 12
- Symptoms must be present in two or more settings (e.g., home and school/work)
- Symptoms must cause clear functional impairment
- Symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder

SUBTYPES:
- Predominantly Inattentive Presentation
- Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation
- Combined Presentation

--------------------------------------------------
ANXIETY DISORDERS (GENERALIZED ANXIETY FOCUS)
--------------------------------------------------

Anxiety disorders involve excessive fear, worry, or avoidance behaviors that are disproportionate
to actual threat and interfere with daily functioning.

GENERALIZED ANXIETY FEATURES:
